I am a PhD student at Princeton University working on machine learning, advsied by [Ryan P. Adams](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rpa/) and [Peter J. Ramadge](https://ee.princeton.edu/people/peter-j-ramadge/). My interests are in deep learning, probalisitic modeling and control theory. My recent research focuses on scalable and robust automatic model selection with applications to AutoML and control.  
  
Previously, I worked with [Sinno Jialin Pan](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/sinnopan/index.html) on distrbuted (federated) multi-task learning at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Before that, I received a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from National University of Singapore.
